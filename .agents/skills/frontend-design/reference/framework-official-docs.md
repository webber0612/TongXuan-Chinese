# Framework Official Docs

Use this reference when a task is clearly tied to a specific frontend framework or meta-framework.

The goal is simple: **before making framework-specific architecture or implementation decisions, consult the official docs for that framework first**. Do not rely on stale memory, generic cross-framework habits, or cargo-culted snippets when the framework has explicit guidance for routing, rendering, data loading, forms, styling, or deployment.

This reference is intentionally a **curated starting map**, not a frozen copy of each ecosystem's documentation. Framework docs evolve quickly. Use the links below to orient yourself, then follow the official docs deeper for the exact feature you are implementing.

## Research workflow

When the project stack is known, do this in order:

1. **Confirm the actual framework in use**
   - Check the existing codebase first.
   - Distinguish plain library usage from a meta-framework (for example `React` vs `Next.js`, `Vue` vs `Nuxt`, `Svelte` vs `SvelteKit`, `Solid` vs `SolidStart`).

2. **Open the official docs entry page for that framework**
   - Start with the framework-specific links below instead of a generic search result.

3. **Read the framework's core architecture pages before coding**
   - project/app structure
   - routing
   - rendering model and server/client boundaries
   - data loading and mutations
   - forms and validation
   - styling and asset handling
   - deployment / SSR / SSG / hydration implications

4. **Then do a focused web search only when needed**
   - If the official docs do not directly answer the version, adapter, or edge-case question, do a focused web search.
   - Verify whatever you find against official docs before treating it as guidance.

## What to check before implementing

When working in a framework-specific stack, review the official docs for the topics most likely to affect correctness:

- how projects are scaffolded and structured
- where routes live and how nested layouts/outlets work
- whether rendering is client-only, server-first, hybrid, or isomorphic by default
- how data loading and mutations are supposed to happen
- how forms, validation, and pending states are expected to work
- how server-only and client-only code should be separated
- how CSS, assets, images, fonts, or framework components are supposed to be wired in
- how deployment mode changes the valid implementation choices

## Official docs starting points

### React

Use when the project is plain React or when a framework-specific answer should be grounded in React's own mental model.

- [React Learn](https://react.dev/learn) — the fastest way to refresh the component model, JSX, state, events, hooks, and data flow
- [React API reference](https://react.dev/reference/react) — hooks, APIs, directives, and low-level reference material
- [Rules of React](https://react.dev/reference/rules) — purity, hook rules, and idiomatic React constraints that affect correctness

Consult React docs first for:

- component composition
- hooks correctness
- state ownership / lifting state
- client component behavior and render purity

### Next.js

Use when the project is Next.js, especially App Router work.

- [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started) — installation, project structure, layouts/pages, navigation, data fetching, mutating, caching, CSS, deployment
- [Server and Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) — when code belongs on the server vs client, serialization, provider placement, environment poisoning pitfalls
- [Rendering Philosophy](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/rendering-philosophy) — how Next treats static vs dynamic as a component-level spectrum
- [Forms](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/forms) — Server Actions, validation, pending states, optimistic updates
- [AI Coding Agents](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/ai-agents) — version-matched bundled docs, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and local agent setup
- [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) — modern scaffolding defaults, including `--agents-md` support and `--no-agents-md` opt-out

Consult Next docs first for:

- App Router conventions
- server/client component boundaries
- caching and revalidation
- Server Actions and forms
- deployment/runtime implications

Next.js-specific agent rule for modern projects:

- if the project uses modern Next.js and has bundled docs at `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`, read the relevant local doc there **before** writing Next.js code
- prefer those bundled local docs over stale model memory because they match the exact installed Next.js version
- if the project was created with modern `create-next-app`, expect `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` to already exist unless the project opted out with `--no-agents-md`
- for existing projects on `v16.2.0-canary.37` or later, recommend the minimal `AGENTS.md` rule that points agents to `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` and a `CLAUDE.md` file containing `@AGENTS.md`
- for older Next.js projects, use the `npx @next/codemod@latest agents-md` codemod, which writes the docs reference to `.next-docs/`

Practical rule:

- official Next.js web docs are the starting map
- bundled local docs are the source of truth when they exist in the project

### TanStack Start

Use when the project is TanStack Start for React or Solid.

Consult Astro docs first for:

- islands architecture and hydration directives
- when to keep things server-rendered vs interactive
- framework integration boundaries
- Astro-specific styling rules and CSS precedence

Default Astro implementation bias:

- prefer Astro components, native HTML elements, and Tailwind-first styling before adding a framework island
- preserve Astro's low-JS / zero-JS-by-default model whenever the feature can be delivered without client-side framework code
- only introduce React-compatible component stacks such as `shadcn/ui` when the user explicitly requests them or the project already depends on that integration

### Inertia

### Motion (React, Vue, and vanilla JavaScript)

Use when the project explicitly asks for **Motion** / **Framer Motion**-style animation primitives, or when an animation-heavy feature needs a framework-matched Motion adapter instead of generic CSS alone.

Important filter before reaching for it:

- if the effect is a simple hover, press, opacity fade, translate entrance, reduced-motion fallback, or other self-contained state transition, prefer modern CSS or Tailwind first
- use Motion when the interaction truly benefits from layout animation, gestures, motion values, framework-linked orchestration, or richer scroll/state coupling

- [Motion quick start for JavaScript](https://motion.dev/docs/quick-start) — install via `npm install motion`, import from `motion`, or use the ESM/CDN path for plain HTML pages
- [Motion for React](https://motion.dev/docs/react) — install via `npm install motion`, import React primitives from `motion/react`
- [Motion for Vue](https://motion.dev/docs/vue) — install via `npm install motion-v`, use `motion-v/nuxt` for Nuxt module integration when relevant

Practical adapter rule:

- **React-based web apps** → `motion` package, imports from `motion/react`
- **Vue-based web apps** → `motion-v`
- **Nuxt projects** → prefer `motion-v/nuxt` when module-style integration is appropriate
- **plain JavaScript / HTML web apps** → `motion` package, imports like `animate` / `scroll` from `motion`, or the documented script-tag path when no bundler is present

Consult Motion docs first for:

- the right package and import path for the current framework
- gesture APIs vs plain CSS interactions
- layout animations, scroll animations, and SVG animation support
- when CSS is the simpler and better choice for self-contained state transitions

Important rule:

- do **not** assume the React adapter for Vue or vanilla JS projects
- do **not** use old `framer-motion` naming as a reason to skip the current official Motion docs
- match the adapter to the project instead of forcing React assumptions into every web stack
- do **not** introduce Motion just because animation exists; many strong UI animations are better as CSS, Tailwind utilities, or WAAPI

## Practical rule for agents

If the framework is known, do **not** jump straight from generic frontend instincts to code.

Instead:

- start from the official docs for that exact framework
- read the framework-specific architecture pages that affect the feature
- only then choose implementation details, component libraries, rendering patterns, or deployment-sensitive behavior

This prevents a lot of subtle mistakes — the sneaky kind that look fine in a code review and then explode at runtime.
