# Frontend Design Reference Index

This folder is the shared doctrine layer for `better-web-ui`.

Use it as a map of the map when you know you need guidance but do not yet know which specific reference file to open.

Important default: the more component-shaped references in this folder are mostly for custom primitives, headless implementations, or plain HTML / CSS / JavaScript builds. If a mature component library already handles the primitive well, match that library first and use the pattern docs mainly for fit, structure, defaults, composition, and surrounding UX decisions. Cross-cutting behavior docs such as destructive actions, onboarding, validation, permissions, or status communication still apply even when a mature library is in use.

## Start here

## Accordions, disclosures, and stacked detail sections

- [accordion UX](./accordion-ux.md)
- [component anatomy](./component-anatomy.md)
- [component accessibility](./component-accessibility.md)

- [component accessibility](./component-accessibility.md)
- [interaction design](./interaction-design.md)
- [error recovery](./error-recovery.md)
- [accessibility testing](./accessibility-testing.md)

- [loading feedback and perceived performance](./loading-feedback-and-perceived-performance.md)
- [error recovery](./error-recovery.md)

- [configurator UX](./configurator-ux.md)
- [slider UX](./slider-ux.md)
- [collection browsing and filtering](./collection-browsing-and-filtering.md)
- [responsive design](./responsive-design.md)

## Comparison, pricing, and decision support

- [feature comparison UX](./feature-comparison-ux.md)
- [pricing and packaging](./pricing-and-packaging.md)

## Carousels, galleries, and multi-panel browsing

- [carousel UX](./carousel-ux.md)

Use this when the work touches gesture-enabled galleries, testimonial sliders, feature rails, onboarding walkthroughs, hero carousels, or other multi-panel content where discoverability and accessibility are easy to get wrong.

Use `live-validation-ux` for **when** validation should fire; use `error-recovery` for what happens after validation or submission fails.

## Booking calendars and scheduling flows

- [date-time picker UX](./date-time-picker-ux.md)
- [date input UX](./date-input-ux.md)

Use these when the work touches flight, train, hotel, appointment, restaurant, rental, or availability-driven date/time selection where flexible dates, range picking, and time-slot filtering matter.

- [colorblindness UX](./colorblindness-ux.md) — semantic states, chart palettes, non-color-only cues, and lightness-aware color choices for color-vision deficiencies
- [complex table UX](./complex-table-ux.md) — read-only/search/editable table architecture, pinned columns, header filters, and desktop-first operational grid design

Use these when the product must present data visually, whether through charts, dense tables, or comparative visualizations, and when accessibility under color-vision deficiencies matters.

## How to use this folder well

- start with the smallest reference that answers the real problem
- use the grouped sections above when the filename is not obvious
- prefer shared doctrine here over duplicating the same guidance inside many skills
- if a task is clearly framework-specific, open [framework official docs](./framework-official-docs.md) before making architecture calls

This folder exists so individual skills can stay focused while still sharing one coherent design brain.
