# Semantic Color

Semantic color is about meaning, not decoration.

## Common Semantic Families

### Success
- confirms completion, healthy status, positive trend

### Warning
- signals caution, pending risk, incomplete conditions

### Error / Destructive
- signals failure, blocked state, dangerous action, irreversible change

### Info
- signals neutral guidance, status, or helpful context

## When Color Is Meaning vs Accent

### Color as meaning
- status badges
- alerts
- validation states
- system messages
- charts where the legend is explicit

### Color as accent
- brand emphasis
- active navigation
- CTA emphasis
- decorative highlights

Do not mix semantic and accent uses carelessly. A branded accent should not accidentally read like an error or warning state.

## Don’t Rely on Color Alone

Semantic color should be supported by:
- icons
- labels
- text
- placement

This helps color-blind users and reduces ambiguity.

## Icon / Text Pairing for Semantic States

Pair semantic color with clear cues:
- success + check / confirmation wording
- warning + alert icon / caution wording
- error + strong verb or consequence text
- info + explanatory label

## Tinted Semantic Surfaces

Often the cleanest semantic treatment is:
- light tinted background
- darker semantic text
- optional icon or border accent

This is often more accessible and less visually aggressive than white text on a very dark colored background.

## Match Semantic Intensity to Attention

Not every status message should look like an alert.

- reserve strong warning and error treatments for risky, blocked, or genuinely cautionary states
- use calmer informational or passive success treatments for routine updates
- badges and status indicators should usually feel ambient, not emergency-coded
- if a message appears frequently, reduce visual aggression before users learn to ignore everything on the screen

Semantic color should reinforce true urgency, not manufacture it.

## Practical Checks

- Is this color communicating meaning or only decoration?
- Would the state still make sense without color?
- Is the semantic ramp defined and reused consistently?
- Are accent colors being mistaken for state colors?

For state colors, legends, chart series, and active/selected cues that must survive color-vision deficiencies, also consult [colorblindness UX](./colorblindness-ux.md).

**Avoid**: using semantic colors as random decoration, making users infer meaning from color alone, or mixing brand accent and state meaning until the interface becomes ambiguous.
